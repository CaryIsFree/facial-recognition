# Realtime Face Emotion Detector

This Realtime Face Emotion Detector repo detects the face displayed on the camera and displays
a text on the frame showing what the model believes what emotion the face is making.

This project uses:
 - Google's Mediapipe Solutions, a suite of libraries and tools that apply artificial intelligence and machine learning to the application.
 More specifically, the "Face detection" and "face landmark detection" vision tasks are used.
 - PyTorch, a machine learning library to build a deep learning model.

The dataset that was used in training the model is "Face expression recognition dataset" by Johnathan Oheix on Kaggle
